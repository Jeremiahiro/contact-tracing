        I-am Vocal is a non profit organization and a proponent for community engagement,
        with one aim; to make social impact. I-am Vocal has built the SOP Contact TracingApp,
        to protect communities and contribute to the improvement of the current state ofthe society.
        This App is not a replacement for the existing methods and measures,rather it is a compliment
        to further ebb transmission and flatten the curve.The SOP App is user friendly and is able to
        manage multiple data streams. The SOPhas very good potential to reduce contagion, manage
        cases and protect medicalprivacies. It offers preventive services to interrupt ongoing
        transmission and in theevent that probable cases become active, it offers crisis
        counselling, screening andreferral of infected persons for further care, with utmost
        protection of users personaldata.This tool will run simultaneously with multiple other
        approaches, to control the virusand eventually blow it over
