        Save One Plus is a social good application developed by the IAMVOCAL ADVOCACY&amp;AWARENESS
        FOUNDATION to manage the data from/of events being organized during this pandemic and to provide
        support to the less privileged.
        <br>
        The country has been striving to contain the spread of the virus coupled with the increasing rate of
        unemployment, poverty and economic relapse and thus, we propose Save One Plus as a tool to organize
        a seamless and controlled event and to assist individuals and households who are in dire need and
        require support to augment their limited resource.
        <br>
        Our aim is to nip the spread and transmission of the virus. We hope to connect individuals and
        communities with potential donors and philanthropists via the support page; individuals who require
        support may make a request and receive assistance as well on the platform.
        <br>
        If thereâ€™s an outbreak, backward tracing can be done to determine the names and contacts of people
        they may have been in contact with.
